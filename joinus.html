The experience was great, since the initial stages, milestone deliveries, QA cycles, App Store deployment, and till this very day when we are about to update for the fifth time with exciting new features. Although MFA Team is an offshore solution for me, working with them I totally have the feeling that Alin, Flavius, Cristian, Ovidiu (and the rest of the bunch) are an integral part of my team. It is great to know that they regard the success of my app to be their success too and take pride in it. Reliable, quick, professional, sympathetic and with great communication skills I couldn`t ask for more. No wonder I recommend MFA Team to my peers, whenever I`m asked if I know any good iPhone application development company. "</p>

                                <p class="comment">" I was looking very carefully for quite a while for a team to develop my iOS game `Find a Way, Jose` and after considering about 15 different development solutions, I have finally decided to hire MFA Team. The experience was great, since the initial stages, milestone deliveries, QA cycles, App Store deployment, and till this very day when we are about to update for the fifth time with exciting new features. Although MFA Team is an offshore solution for me, working with them I totally have the feeling that Alin, Flavius, Cristian, Ovidiu (and the rest of the bunch) are an integral part of my team. It is great to know that they regard the success of my app to be their success too and take pride in it. Reliable, quick, professional, sympathetic and with great communication skills I couldn`t ask for more. No wonder I recommend MFA Team to my peers, whenever I`m asked if I know any good iPhone application development company. "</p>
