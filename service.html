                        <p>Since we started Mobiversal in 2011, we’ve received over 1000 requests to build apps and we’ve discussed with many app entrepreneurs to help them kickstart their business. Based on our experience of building over 60 apps for our clients and of working on our own products, we can evaluate your idea and see what needs to be done to increase the chances of having a successful project.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="tab-2" class="tab-content">
                        <p>We work with you to understand your idea and we merge your initial concept with everything our team knows about mobile apps. We establish what features go into the product, how they will work together, and we create a Product Requirements and Specifications Document (See a sample for a simple app and for a complex one). This document is the foundation for all the steps to come. It will be used by our designers to come up with designs and by our developers as a guideline for coding. It will also allow us to give you the most accurate price quote and you’re free to use this document to request quotes from other companies too.</p>
                        <p>Price: $350 for simple projects (standalone app with up to 10 screens)<br>$750 for complex projects (app with over 10 screens, backend, API etc.)</p>
                        <p>What you pay at this stage serves as a deposit and will be deducted from the total price, when you decide to move on with the project.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="tab-3" class="tab-content">
                        <p>Wireframes are the skeleton behind the user interface and they contain all the elements that go into every screen. They do not define the “look and feel”, but rather the layout, hierarchy, and interaction schema that is responsible for a good “user experience”. Wireframing saves time because our development team understands easier what needs to be built and it also reduces the risk of leaving certain things out. Price: $250 for a simple app (up to 10 screens); Starting from $500 for complex apps.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="tab-4" class="tab-content">
                        <p>When it comes to first impressions, it’s all about design. By identifying and understanding the essence and core values of your brand, we create your unique identity. We’ll put our passion for good design to work and based on approved wireframes we’ll design all screens. We`ll craft a beautiful, functional design with your specific users in mind.</p>
                        <p>Price: $500 - Identity (Logo, App Icon)<br>$1,000 - UI/UX Design for a simple app (up to 10 screens); Starting from $2,000 for complex apps.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="tab-5" class="tab-content">
                        <p>Development isn’t just about writing code. The very first step in developing an awesome app is figuring out its architecture. Our lead architect and a team of senior developers pick the perfect technologies for your app. The app development process is broken down into sprints based on feature sets and our agile approach will allow you to regularly review and assess what we’re building. Our Quality Assurance team will test the app after each development sprint and once all major functionality is implemented, we’ll prepare a Beta Build. Price: Depends on the complexity of your app and the number of platforms. We’ll give you a fixed price quote based on the Product Requirements and Specifications Document (created by us at the first step or provided by you).</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="tab-6" class="tab-content">
                        <p>After passing the Beta Build through a final round of QA and refinements, we’ll have in our hands a Release Candidate Build. Once we have the build ready, we set up the in-app products (if it’s the case), and we publish your app. If it’s built for iOS devices, we make sure it gets through Apple’s App Store acceptance process. We provide our clients with a 3 months bug fixing period (after releasing the final version), free of charge, and maintenance packages that cover everything from small updates all the way to whole new versions.</p>
                        <p>Price: $150/store - Publishing</p>
                        <p>Maintenance packages are priced as a fixed fee based on agreed scope of work, or alternatively based on hourly rate.</p>

                                <p class="comment">" I was looking very carefully for quite a while for a team to develop my iOS game `Find a Way, Jose` and after considering about 15 different development solutions, I have finally decided to hire Mobiversal. The experience was great, since the initial stages, milestone deliveries, QA cycles, App Store deployment, and till this very day when we are about to update for the fifth time with exciting new features. Although Mobiversal is an offshore solution for me, working with them I totally have the feeling that Alin, Flavius, Cristian, Ovidiu (and the rest of the bunch) are an integral part of my team. It is great to know that they regard the success of my app to be their success too and take pride in it. Reliable, quick, professional, sympathetic and with great communication skills I couldn`t ask for more. No wonder I recommend Mobiversal to my peers, whenever I`m asked if I know any good iPhone application development company. "</p>

                                <p class="comment">" I was looking very carefully for quite a while for a team to develop my iOS game `Find a Way, Jose` and after considering about 15 different development solutions, I have finally decided to hire Mobiversal. The experience was great, since the initial stages, milestone deliveries, QA cycles, App Store deployment, and till this very day when we are about to update for the fifth time with exciting new features. Although Mobiversal is an offshore solution for me, working with them I totally have the feeling that Alin, Flavius, Cristian, Ovidiu (and the rest of the bunch) are an integral part of my team. It is great to know that they regard the success of my app to be their success too and take pride in it. Reliable, quick, professional, sympathetic and with great communication skills I couldn`t ask for more.
